\noindent \BlueText{\textbf{Exercise 4:} Attempt to replicate the
following in black text.}
\vspace{1cm}

Here is a paragraph with an indent.

\noindent Here is a new paragraph with no indent at all followed by 2
centimeters of vertical whitespace.

\vspace{2cm}

Here is my name in quotes in the center of the page with 1 inch of
space between the first and last name. \BlueText{$\leftarrow$ use your
own name}

\begin{center}
	``YOUR \hspace{1in} NAME''
\end{center}

\vspace{5ex}

After about 5 x's worth of vertical space below my name, I can now say
I have achieved the basics of adding whitespace.
